# oaxmlapi

## DESCRIPTION
oaxmlapi is a Python wrapper around the NetSuite OpenAir XML API.

This library allows for easier interaction with the XML API, and reduces the need to generate raw XML. The library is written entirely in Python and utilizes the etree.ElementTree library for producing pre-formatted XML tags and attributes for use in your API requests.
